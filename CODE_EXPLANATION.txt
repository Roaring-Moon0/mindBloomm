Hello MindBloom Team! üå∏

Here is a guide to the "Gratitude Tree" journal feature. This feature is designed to be an engaging and positive experience, encouraging users to build a consistent journaling habit.

### 1. The Core Concept: The Gratitude Tree üå≥

The central idea is to turn daily journaling into a rewarding game.

- **Growth:** Each user gets a personal "Gratitude Tree." This tree starts as a small seed.
- **Nurturing:** Every time a user writes a journal entry, the tree grows a little bigger. We've defined specific stages: Seed -> Sprout -> Sapling -> Young Tree -> Flourishing Tree.
- **Personalization:** Users can give their tree a custom name, making it feel truly their own.
- **Motivation:** Seeing the tree grow provides a visual reward and a gentle nudge to continue the habit. If a user hasn't written in a while, we can show a reminder on their dashboard that their tree "needs them."

### 2. How the Code Works (The File Map) üó∫Ô∏è

The journal feature is built from several connected pieces.

- **`src/app/journal/page.tsx` (The Front Door)**
    - This is the main page file for the `yourwebsite.com/journal` URL.
    - Its primary job is **security**. It checks if a user is logged in. If not, it shows an "Access Denied" message and asks them to log in. If they are logged in, it shows the main `JournalClientPage`.

- **`src/app/journal/journal-client.tsx` (The Main Screen)**
    - This is where the main user interface lives.
    - It uses our custom `useFirestoreCollection` and `useFirestoreDocument` hooks to fetch the user's journal entries and the current state of their tree (like its name and entry count) from the database in real-time.
    - It arranges the page layout, placing the `JournalTree` on one side and the `JournalEditor` and past entries on the other.

- **`src/components/journal/JournalTree.tsx` (The Visuals)**
    - This component's only job is to display the tree.
    - It receives the `entryCount` and calculates which tree image to show using the logic in `src/lib/journal-utils.ts`.
    - It also displays the tree's name and allows the user to edit it.

- **`src/components/journal/JournalEditor.tsx` (The Notepad)**
    - This is the form where users type their daily gratitude entry.
    - When the user clicks "Save Entry," this component calls the `addJournalEntry` function from our backend service.

- **`src/components/journal/JournalEntryCard.tsx` (The History)**
    - This is a small card component that displays a single past journal entry, including the date it was written and the content.
    - It also includes the "delete" button for that specific entry.

### 3. How the Database is Organized (The Filing Cabinet) üóÑÔ∏è

We use the Firestore database, and to keep every user's data private and secure, we store everything under their unique User ID.

Imagine a filing cabinet called `users`. Inside, there's a folder for each user, labeled with their `uid`.

- **`users/{userId}/entries/`**: This is where all of a user's individual journal entries are stored. Each entry is a separate document with the text and a timestamp.
- **`users/{userId}/journal/state`**: This is a single, special document that holds the settings for the user's tree. It stores:
    - `entryCount`: The total number of entries they've written.
    - `treeName`: The custom name they've given their tree.
    - `lastEntryDate`: The date of their most recent post, which we use for the dashboard reminder.

This structure is highly secure because our **Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)** are set up to only allow a user to read or write to the folder that matches their own `uid`. You can't see anyone else's entries, and they can't see yours.

### 4. The Backend Logic (`src/services/journal-service.ts`)

This file contains the "server functions" that do the actual work of saving and deleting data.

- **`addJournalEntry(content)`**:
    1. Checks that a user is logged in.
    2. Securely adds the new entry document to the `entries` collection.
    3. **Atomically** increases the `entryCount` in the `journal/state` document by 1. (Using a "transaction" ensures this either all happens or not at all, preventing data corruption).

- **`deleteJournalEntry(entryId)`**:
    1. Checks that a user is logged in.
    2. Deletes the specified entry document.
    3. **Atomically** decreases the `entryCount` by 1.

- **`updateTreeName(name)`**:
    1. Checks that a user is logged in.
    2. Updates the `treeName` field in the `journal/state` document.

This feature is a great example of how we can build powerful, secure, and engaging experiences using the tools we have. Well done, team!

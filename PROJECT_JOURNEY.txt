Hello, MindBloom Team!

Welcome to the story of our amazing project! Think of what we've built as a magical online treehouse, a special, cozy place where people can go when they need to feel calm, happy, and understood.

Here is a simple tour of all the wonderful rooms and gadgets we've built for our treehouse so far.

### 1. The Front Door (Our Home Page)

This is the beautiful, welcoming entrance. The first thing visitors see is a picture of a calm, peaceful lake at sunrise to make them feel relaxed right away. The front door gives a preview of all the amazing things inside and invites them to come in and explore.

### 2. Secret Keys (Signing Up & Logging In)

To make sure everyone has their own private little corner in our treehouse, we created a system with secret keys. People can create their own key (an account) with their email and a password, or they can use their special Google key to get in. This keeps everyone's space safe and sound.

### 3. Your Personal Room (The Dashboard)

Once someone comes inside, they get their very own personal room! Here, they can see their name and a welcome message. There are also magic buttons that work as shortcuts to take them directly to their favorite activities, like talking to the wise owl or playing calming games. We even included a special picture frame that shows a new inspirational quote every day!

### 4. The Library of Whispering Woods (Resources Page)

We built a huge library filled with enchanted scrolls (articles), magic mirrors (videos), and listening shells (music). It’s organized into different sections like "Anxiety Relief" and "Better Sleep" so people can easily find the wisdom they're looking for. There's even a magic magnifying glass (a search bar) to help them find things even faster!

### 5. The Wise Old Owl (AI Chat Assistant)

In a quiet corner of our treehouse lives a very wise and friendly computer owl. Anyone can go and chat with it. You can tell the owl how you're feeling, and it will listen patiently and give you kind, helpful suggestions and comforting words. It's like having a wise friend who is always there for you.

### 6. The Garden of Games (Calming Games)

We created a beautiful garden with three special games to help visitors relax:
*   **The Breathing Flower:** A flower that slowly blooms and shrinks, helping you breathe in and out calmly.
*   **Color Matching:** A fun and simple game where you match colors to help your mind focus.
*   **Memory Game:** A game of finding matching pictures of happy things like suns and stars to give your brain a gentle, fun puzzle.

### 7. The Story of Us (About Page)

This room tells the story of our team—the amazing builders of this treehouse! It shares our mission to help everyone feel better and introduces each team member with their picture and what they do.

### 8. The Mailbox (Contact Page & FAQs)

If anyone has a question or wants to send us a message, they can use our magical mailbox. We also put up a big board with answers to questions people ask a lot, so they can get help right away.
